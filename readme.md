# Force

Force is a vector quantity that influences the motion of an object. It can cause a change in the object's speed or direction of movement.

## Types of Forces

1. **Contact Forces:** These forces act when objects are in direct contact, such as friction, normal force, tension, and applied force.
2. **Non-contact Forces:** Forces that can act on objects without physical contact, like gravity and electromagnetic forces.

# Newton's Laws of Motion

**1. Newton's First Law (Law of Inertia):**

- An object at rest will remain at rest, and an object in motion will continue moving at a constant velocity unless acted upon by an external force.
- This law essentially describes the concept of inertia, the tendency of an object to maintain its state of motion.

**2. Newton's Second Law:**

- This law states that the force acting on an object is directly proportional to the rate of change of its momentum. Mathematically, F = ma (Force equals mass times acceleration).
- It explains how the acceleration of an object is affected by the force applied to it.

**3. Newton's Third Law:**

- For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. When one object exerts a force on another, the second object exerts an equal force in the opposite direction.
- This law helps to understand interactions between different objects and systems.
